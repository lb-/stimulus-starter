      <div class="section title">
        <p>Around the World in 80 Days</p>

      <div class="section passenger">
        <p>"There is no young lady on board,"</p>
        <p>interrupted the purser.</p>
        <p>"Here is a list of the passengers;</p>
        <p>you may see for yourself."</p>
        <p><span class="name">Passepartout</span> scanned the list,</p>
        <p>but his master's name was not upon it.</p>
        <p>All at once an idea struck him.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section yokohama">
        <p>"Ah! am I on the Carnatic?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"On the way to Yokohama?"</p>
        <p>"Certainly."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section wrong">
        <p>
          <span class="name">Passepartout</span> had for an instant feared that
          he was on the wrong boat;
        </p>
        <p>
          but, though he was really on the Carnatic, his master was not there.
        </p>

      <div class="section fogg">
        <p>He fell thunderstruck on a seat.</p>
        <p>He saw it all now.</p>
        <p>He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed,</p>
        <p>that he should have informed his master of that fact,</p>
        <p>and that he had not done so.</p>
        <p>
          It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the
          steamer.
        </p>
        <p class="emphasis">
          Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who,
        </p>
        <p>in order to separate him from his master,</p>
        <p>and detain the latter at Hong Kong,</p>
        <p class="emphasis">had inveigled him into getting drunk!</p>
        <p>He now saw the detective's trick;</p>
        <p>and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined,</p>
        <p>his bet was lost,</p>
        <p>and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned!</p>
        <p>
          At this thought <span class="name">Passepartout</span> tore his hair.
        </p>
        <p>Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach,</p>
        <p>what a settling of accounts there would be!</p>
